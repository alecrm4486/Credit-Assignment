# Credit-Assignment
The objective of this project was to provide the most accurate classification possible in a client score dataset. 
In order to do that I am going to test three algorithms namely classification decision trees, random forest and adaptive boosting. 
I've compared the accuracy of these techniques as well as ranked the features by order of importance in building the classification.
I used a data on financial credit approval belong to Japanese company that grants credits. 
The dataset contains 690 cases, 15 features, a variable corresponding to class attribute, and a small percentage of missing values.
This dataset has a particular attractiveness for the application machine learning algorithms because it contains a good mix of features (e.g. continues, categorical with two or more categories) 
combined with a class attribute variable with two categories (e.g. clients receive a good or bad credit status).
